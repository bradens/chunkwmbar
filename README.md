# chunkwmbar
Zenbar like chunkwm widget to show current space. 

### Installation: 

* Make sure you have [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) installed. 
* Install [Zenbar](https://github.com/zhaorz/zenbar). 
* Ensure you have [chunkwm](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) installed and running.
* Download this and place the folder in your widgets directory. 

### TODO

* Query for the number of spaces, don't assume there are four. 
* Make the areas clickable to take you to that space.
* Find way to refresh the widget when you change spaces -- would reduce the need to have high refresh rate. 
* Show windows status inside the boxes maybe?

Open to PRS :)
